# How to Create Firebase Indexes for Expense Tracker

1. Go to Firebase Console:
   - Visit https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select your project: expense-tracker-ad1c0

2. Navigate to Indexes:
   - Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Select the "Indexes" tab
   - Click "Create Index"

3. Create Index for Settlement Transactions:
   Collection ID: users/{userId}/expenses
   
   Fields:
   - isSettlement (Ascending)
   - date (Descending)
   
   Click "Create Index"

4. Create Index for Related Transactions:
   Collection ID: users/{userId}/expenses
   
   Fields:
   - relatedTransactionId (Ascending)
   - date (Descending)
   
   Click "Create Index"

Important Notes:
- Indexes take a few minutes to build
- You'll see a "Building" status while the index is being created
- Wait for the status to change to "Enabled" before using queries that depend on these indexes
- These indexes support queries that:
  1. Find all settlement transactions sorted by date
  2. Find all transactions related to a specific original transaction sorted by date

Example Queries These Indexes Support:

```typescript
// Query settlement transactions
const settlementQuery = query(
  collection(db, `users/${userId}/expenses`),
  where('isSettlement', '==', true),
  orderBy('date', 'desc')
);

// Query related transactions
const relatedQuery = query(
  collection(db, `users/${userId}/expenses`),
  where('relatedTransactionId', '==', 'some-id'),
  orderBy('date', 'desc')
);
```

Verification:
- After creating indexes, they should appear in the Indexes list
- Status should change from "Building" to "Enabled"
- Your queries should work without any "missing index" errors
